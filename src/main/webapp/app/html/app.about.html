    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Physician Compare is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website that helps you find and choose physicians 
          and other health care professionals enrolled in Medicare so that you can make informed choices about the health care you get, as required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010.</p>
        <p>At this time you can compare group practices on Physician Compare. You'll be able to compare individual physicians and other health care professionals in the future.</p>

    <h3>Who’s included</h3>
        <p>Physician Compare includes only physicians and other health care professionals who are currently enrolled in Medicare.</p>
        <p>It can take 3-6 months for new physicians, other health care professionals, and group practices to be added to 
          Physician Compare after they enroll in Medicare. Visit Physician Compare regularly to find new and updated listings.</p>
    <h3>Always check the information</h3>
        <p>Even though we update Physician Compare often, information can change. Always contact the health care professional to find out if
           they accept Medicare assignment, if they’re accepting new Medicare patients, and to check the address.</p>
